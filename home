Hello, I am a faculty member at Faculty of Computer Science and Applications, Charotar University of Science and Technology, Changa and teach various courses at a postgraduate level programme. Previously I was associated with Ahmedabad University and GLS University.

I did my PhD in Computer Science. I have keen interests in the field of information security using machine learning, assistive technology, and precision agriculture.

My model hero is Mahatma Gandhi. I have been learning many things from him. I am a simple human being, believe in “Simple living, High thinking”.

I never teach my pupils. I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn. – Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955)
